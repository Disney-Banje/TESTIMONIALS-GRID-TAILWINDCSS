# Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

# Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me to design the layout and other styling processes. I liked how everything is Html based and it seems a lot easier to detect bugs in the code compared with solely using CSS-based workflow which I think is more. Of course, learning a new workflow comes with its cons at first it was a bit hard but slowly and steadily I found my way and was able to complete the project.
